_This is a modified version of EasySwUpload. I added several things for my own use (like the jsProgressBarHandler 0.3.3 - by Bramus)
and fixed some issues that I came across. Please have a look at the original version from 'over' http://github.com/over/easy_swf_upload
which may fit your needs better._

= EasySwfUpload

This plugin will help you to embed swf upload into your project

First, install this plugin:
  script/plugin install git://github.com/over/easy_swf_upload.git
  #script/generate easy_swf_upload is called for you automatically

== Example

In your application.html.erb include javascripts:

  <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults, :swf_upload %>
  
Or on a specific page (assuming the prototype libraries are loaded in your application template):

  <% content_for :javascript do %>
	<%= javascript_include_tag :swf_upload %>
  <% end %>

The Plugin does not works without the prototype javascript library.

Then, use this helper to embed swf upload to your application:
  <%= swf_upload_area :url => upload_image_block_path,
          :filetypes => "*.jpg; *.gif",
          :button_text => "Upload",
          :button_style => "font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; font-weight:bold;" %>

If you want to allow uploading of only a single file, you can pass :single_file => true option to swf_upload_area helper.

If you want a file size limit use the file_size_limit option, for example :file_size_limit => "2 MB". The default file size limit = 40 MB.

Another example with a button image, and single file upload:

  <%= swf_upload_area :url => upload_image_block_path,
          :filetypes => "*.jpg; *.gif",
          :single_file => true,
          :file_size_limit => "100 MB"
          :button_image_url => "../images/XPButtonUploadText_61x22.png",
          :button_width => 61,
          :button_height => 22 %>

In your controller:
  class PagesController < ApplicationController
	# If your rails version < 2.3.0, go this way
    session :cookie_only => false, :only => :upload_image_block # this is very important, don't forget to set it to false

    def upload_image_block
      @image_block = ImageBlock.new(:file => swf_upload_data) # here you can use your favourite plugin to work with attachments

      # use RJS here
      # render :action => "upload_image_block.js.rjs"
      render :update do |page|
        page['blocks'].insert("<div><img src="http://domain.com" /></div>")
      end
    end
  end


Also, you need to customize uploading area, for example:
  <style>
  .uploadContainer {
    margin: 0; padding: 0;
  }

  .uploadContainer li {
    list-style: none;
    margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 2em;
    padding: 0.4em; border: #ccc; margin-bottom: 1em;
  }

  .uploadContainer li h6 {
    margin: 0; padding: 0; color: #000;
    font-size: 1.1em;
  }
  </style>

Uploading file template:

  <li id="#{id}"><h6>#{title}</h6><span id="#{id}_progress">[ Loading Progress Bar ]</span></li>
